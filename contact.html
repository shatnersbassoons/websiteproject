<p>5 years ago I decided to start drawing, I hadn't done any artwork since I was at school (a long time ago). 
After I completed my first drawing (as shown here), 
I wanted to get some hints and tips on how I could improve on this and make it stand out. 
I looked on the internet and found a number of tutorials, however, this was not specific to 'my' drawing. 
So, I decided to make a community where people can upload and display their work and get tips, tricks and constructive criticism.
